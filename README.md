# Inspiration for the topic
With the latest trend in technologies, people don't like to wait if their web pages don't load within seconds or wait at the restaurant for the food to be delievered. The project was inspired from the waiting time experienced by customers when they call the bank for customer service. The wait time in this case was 30 mins which is a lot of time and it's very difficult to wait for such a long time.
While studying for my course of Data Analysis and Decision making, it was required to develop an end of course project that solved some business problems. So, I and my team came up with developing a system that tries to solve the waiting time.

# Execution
We used our academic tools like R programming language, probability theory, and the modelling and simulation concepts for the executon of the entire project
- Built a model that simulated the customer waiting time of 30 mins at bank’s call center and 15 mins at the doctors’ clinic using single queuing system
- Adopted M/M/C queuing model to visualize the changes in the environment thereby minimizing the wait time 
- Leveraged R’s simmer library that restricts the wait time for customers to 10 mins at the call center and 5 mins at the doctor’s clinic
