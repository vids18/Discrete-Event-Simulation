# Discrete-Event-Simulation
This is a college project made by me and my 7 other team members. 
This project was a part of my subject's end result where I have written R-codes for the topic of Discrete Event Simulation.
We have taken two problem statements from the call center domain and the healthcare sector and tried to implement simple R-codes.
